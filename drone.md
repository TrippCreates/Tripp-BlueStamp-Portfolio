# Custom Drone
This project was by far my favorite. It had the best end product, and I got to combine so many disciplines. I did a lot of electrical engineering, some mechanical work on the hardware, 3D-printed some custom mounts and did lots of online shopping for parts. The project got me even deeper into the RC world, and it was so modular that I felt like I could do anything and go anywhere with it.

# First Milestone

**Overview**\
For this first milestone, it was about getting the drone up in the air, whatever that meant. So while the drone lacked a lot of capabilities or cool features, it could fly, and that was a good start. 

**Accomplishments**\
My main accomplishment is building a drone. I had never worked with such complicated electronics before, and this was a difficult but rewarding introduction. I became quite good at soldering, learned how to use a multimeter to check all my connections, and importantly I started to understand the ins and outs of electrical engineering. 

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge had to be soldering. I had soldered a little before this project, however it was no where to the degree of this projects volume or complexity. There were so many joints that I had to create and often they were in hard to reach places. However, I feel I have become quite capable with the soldering iron and I know that will serve me well for the future. 

**Next Step**\
For my next milestone, I plan to integrate a camera system so I can film my flights. I'm hoping I can attach a GoPro to the drone in order to record the views the drone sees. 



# Second Milestone
<!---For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone-->

**Overview**\
This is the second milestone of my drone. This milestone was about trying to film my flights. I knew that a GoPro would easily provide high quality film so I decided to try and integrate it into my build.  

**Accomplishments**\
The accomplishment of this build was designing and 3D printing a mount for a GoPro. It took many iterations to get the right tolerances and design but when the GoPro finally fit and I collected my first footage it was an awesome feeling. 

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge of this milestone was weight. The added mass of the GoPro depleted the battery of the drone much quicker than expected, this meant that I had to order a bigger battery and find ways I could cut weight on other parts of the drone. 

**Next Step**\
My next step is to integrate an FPV camera into the build that is capable of feeding me live footage of the flight that I can view through a FPV headset. 


# Final Milestone

**Overview**\
This is the Final milestone of my drone. I successfully integrated within it a FPV system in which I can watch live the view from my drone as I fly it. 

**Accomplishments**\
The accomplishment of this milestone was adding an FPV system. I had to connect transmitters, solder on more wires, and find space for a camera on my already too-heavy drone. Overall, it was very cool to work with camera systems which was something completely new to me. Getting to fly the drone from a live view was also a feeling like no other that might piloting a drone much easier. 

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge for this milestone was working with filming equipment. I had never worked with cameras and the electronics for these systems are very fragile and expensive. This meant I had to be extra careful while implementing the FPV systems. 

**Next Step**\
For now, I am done with this project. However, in the future I want to increase the autonomous abilities of the drone.
