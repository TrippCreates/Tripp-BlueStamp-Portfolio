# Foam RC Airplane
My first large-scale project was the Foam RC Airplane, which I built from scratch. The biggest challenge of this project came when trying to make the plane balanced and easily flyable. I was a worse pilot than I was an engineer. Even so, I knew almost nothing about aerodynamics and any physics overall going into this, but that made the experience much better because I learned so much from it. The biggest takeaway is that integration is really hard. I easily put together the electronics and then in turn, the hardware, which was just a foam plane design I made up, but integrating the two and getting them to work well together took literal months, where every night I was attempting to get the two opposing forces to come together in harmony.

**Overview**\
This is the Final milestone of my foam RC Plane. For this milestone I made a great attempt at flight and had sustained airtime, enough to satisfy my needs. 

**Accomplishments**\
Since the prior milestone, I've made only a few changes to the plane. I made better compartments that let me easily access the inside, change things up if needed, or plug things back in. I also added weights to the front of the plane to better balance the center of gravity and make things more aerodynamic. Finally, I spent time in an online flight simulator to practice my skills in a more controlled environment. 

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge of this part was controlling the plane in air. I got my take-offs to be more consistent, but once I had a flight, I had no idea what to do, and it took a long time to get some semblance of control. 

**Next Step**\
For now, I am done with the plane. I want to move on to other projects that I have in mind, but in the future, I do want to come back to it by either building another better-looking and performing model or just adding some features like a cargo bay to the existing prototype. 


# Second Milestone
<!---For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone-->

**Overview**\
This is the second milestone of my foam RC Plane. For this milestone I am making solid attempts at flight, but still struggling to get consistently up in the air.

**Accomplishments**\
Some technical accomplishments I've made are that the hardware and electronics for the plane are done. I have the design down, so even if I were to crash and break it, I could rebuild it, and it would work. Since the first iteration, I made a couple of switches that might not be obvious. First, I made the front sturdier to hold the propeller in properly. By combining screws, glue, and a solid piece of wood, I was able to make a solid place for the motor to attach to. I've also made some organizational changes within the chassis. I had problems with the battery sliding back and unplugging or shifting the center of gravity while in the air, so I made a system using wooden dowels that kept the battery firmly in place.

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge so far has been take-offs. I cannot consistently set up a way for myself to get up in the air and actually practice flying around. Every time I go out to fly, I try to take off, and for the most part, the plane just floats down, hits the ground, and breaks off its propeller. 

**Next Step**\
Before I can say I am done with this project, I want sustained flight. No matter how I take off it does not matter, if my plane is in the air and I am in control, I am happy and I can say I am done.

**Overview**\
This is the first milestone of my foam RC Plane. For this milestone, I have built the first iteration of the plane. I've made no attempts to fly it, but I hope that all my hardware and electronics are solid. 

**Accomplishments**\
My main accomplishment is designing a foam airplane that could, in theory, fly. I came up with a few mechanisms with the materials I have, such as the elevator and rudder mechanisms, and I am really proud of them. Building the plane took a lot of work. I had to spend a lot of time researching the electronics, ensuring everything was compatible and working while also trying not to set anything on fire. So finally having some work to show for feels great. 

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge had to be the electronics. I knew nothing about RC going into this, so when I first got all my parts, when I put it all together, nothing worked. I ended up going to a hobby store and just asking for help, thankfully the people there were really nice and they clearly explained to me how everything integrated, and soon enough my electronics were working. 

**Next Step**\
For my next milestone, I plan to make solid flight attempts. While I feel like my design could fly, I predict some changes will need to be made, and I will figure out those changes once I see what does not work in practice.
