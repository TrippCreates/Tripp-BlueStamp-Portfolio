# 3D Printed Model Rocket
This project got me into the area of 3D printing. Through the power of some leftover money from an old job combined with the Christmas season, I ended up getting my hands on a new 3D printer. I was beyond excited because I could now start printing out my own parts for projects. Before this, I would have to scour my garage for cardboard and wood and make a shotty attempt at a design for something like a mount. Now I could use precision printing to do what felt like anything. I decided to make a model rocket and make all the complimentary parts out of PLA. It was super fun and it taught me so much about CAD and the intricacies of the software.

# First Milestone

**Overview**\
For this first milestone, it was about building a prototype. I wanted to see if my ideas would work in practice, so I just took any junk I could find and tested to see if it would work. 

**Accomplishments**\
My main accomplishment is designing a model rocket from scratch. I took cardboard, golf club tubing, push pins, plastic champagne flutes, anything I could find to build a prototype. It did not need to be the most aerodynamic object in the world, I just wanted to test my theories and see if I could put something quick and simple together. 

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge had to be the integrating. I took all these incompatible parts, and I had to find a way to put them all together. It was a super fun challenge trying to be creative in new ways to get everything to work. 

**Next Step**\
For my next milestone, I plan to launch the rocket, see what works and what doesn't, and from there, see what parts I should design and 3D print for model two. 



# Second Milestone
<!---For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone-->

**Overview**\
This is the second milestone of my foam RC Plane. For this milestone I am making solid attempts at flight, but still struggling to get consistently up in the air.

**Accomplishments**\
Some technical accomplishments I've made are that the hardware and electronics for the plane are done. I have the design down, so even if I were to crash and break it, I could rebuild it, and it would work. Since the first iteration, I made a couple of switches that might not be obvious. First, I made the front sturdier to hold the propeller in properly. By combining screws, glue, and a solid piece of wood, I was able to make a solid place for the motor to attach to. I've also made some organizational changes within the chassis. I had problems with the battery sliding back and unplugging or shifting the center of gravity while in the air, so I made a system using wooden dowels that kept the battery firmly in place.

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge so far has been take-offs. I cannot consistently set up a way for myself to get up in the air and actually practice flying around. Every time I go out to fly, I try to take off, and for the most part, the plane just floats down, hits the ground, and breaks off its propeller. 

**Next Step**\
Before I can say I am done with this project, I want sustained flight. No matter how I take off it does not matter, if my plane is in the air and I am in control, I am happy and I can say I am done. 



# Final Milestone

**Overview**\
This is the Final milestone of my foam RC Plane. For this milestone I made a great attempt at flight and had sustained airtime, enough to satisfy my needs. 

**Accomplishments**\
Since the prior milestone, I've made only a few changes to the plane. I made better compartments that let me easily access the inside, change things up if needed, or plug things back in. I also added weights to the front of the plane to better balance the center of gravity and make things more aerodynamic. Finally, I spent time in an online flight simulator to practice my skills in a more controlled environment. 

**Challenges**\
The biggest challenge of this part was controlling the plane in air. I got my take-offs to be more consistent, but once I had a flight, I had no idea what to do, and it took a long time to get some semblance of control. 

**Next Step**\
For now, I am done with the plane. I want to move on to other projects that I have in mind, but in the future, I do want to come back to it by either building another better-looking and performing model or just adding some features like a cargo bay to the existing prototype.
